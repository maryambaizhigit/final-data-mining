In this report, the main in-depth understanding and analysis of unsupervised learning - Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest. A decision tree is a classification and regression model represented by a tree-like structure. It starts from the root node, divides it from top to bottom according to the optimal attribute, and finally outputs the leaf node as the classification result value. In order to prevent the problem of overfitting, random forest is equivalent to multiple decision trees. Since knn needs to traverse all the remaining points every time it finds the next closest point, its algorithmic cost is very high.

## Introduction
In this report, the main in-depth understanding and analysis of unsupervised learning - Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest.
A decision tree is a classification and regression model represented by a tree-like structure. It starts from the root node, divides it from top to bottom according to the optimal attribute, and finally outputs the leaf node as the classification result value.
In order to prevent the problem of overfitting, random forest is equivalent to multiple decision trees.
Since knn needs to traverse all the remaining points every time it finds the next closest point, its algorithmic cost is very high.
                                                                                                                                                      

## Dependencies 

- ```Python3```
- ```Numpy```
- ```Pandas```
- ```Matplotlib```
- ```Supervised Learning```
- ```Machine Learning Algorithm```
- ```Classification Algorithms``` 

## Goal for this Notebook:
Show  an analysis in Python using a full complement of PyData utilities. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field or those who are already in the field and looking to see an example of an analysis done with Python.

## This Notebook will show basic examples of:

- Data Handling
- Importing Data with Pandas
- Cleaning Data
- Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

## Data Analysis
Supervised Machine learning Techniques: + Decision Tree + KNN + Plotting results + Basic Random Forest + Plotting results

## Valuation of the Analysis
- K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
- Output the results from the IPython Notebook 


## Result
The output of the code is to predict the gender(0-female,1-male).
